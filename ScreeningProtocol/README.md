  <h2>Welcome to the Participation Screening Session for the Mumble Melody Longitudinal Study on Stuttering</h2>
  <p>Thank you for your interest in participating in this study. We are studying how changing the way one hears one’s own voice affects speech fluency in people who stutter.

    <h3>Background Information</h3>
    <p>Stuttering affects ~1% of the population worldwide. This condition is characterized by involuntary repetitions, blockages, and prolongations of sound during speaking. From prior studies, we know that fluency can be increased by playing back one’s own voice fractions of a second after it is spoken - this is known as “delayed auditory feedback”. Altering the pitch of one’s own voice - making it sound lower or higher - produces a similar, fluency-evoking effect. There are commercially-available technologies that take advantage of these observations by continuously playing a recording into the ear. These systems, however, are expensive, often do not work long term, and cannot be easily personalized. We are interested in developing an approach that is more user-friendly and effective in the long term.

    <p> Those who qualify for weekly testing sessions can only qualify if their stuttering is at a moderate to severe level during the screening process, which means stutter-like disfluencies in more than 3% of total spoken syllables. This doesn’t have anything to do with YOUR identity as a person who stutters, whether the Mumble Melody app will be useful for you, or what situations you may stutter less or more than you did during the screening portion of the study. This only has to do with our screening procedure for the study. If you have downloaded or tried the Mumble Melody app and feel it has been beneficial to you, you are welcome to continue using the app until it expires.
